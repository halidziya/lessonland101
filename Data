1080° Snowboarding is a 1998 snowboarding video game developed by Nintendo Entertainment Analysis & Development and published by Nintendo. It was released for the Nintendo 64 and re-released in 2008 for the Wii's Virtual Console. In the game, the player controls one of five snowboarders from a third-person perspective, using a combination of buttons to snowboard past flags, jump and perform tricks over eight levels. The objective is either to arrive quickly at a level's finish line or to receive maximum points for grabbing or spinning the board in trick combinations. 1080° was announced in November 1997 and developed over the course of nine months; it garnered critical acclaim and won an Interactive Achievement Award from the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences. It sold over two million units, and a second installment, 1080° Avalanche, was released for the Nintendo GameCube in November 2003.
